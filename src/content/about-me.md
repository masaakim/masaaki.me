My name is Masaaki Morishita. I'm a Japanese software designer, I don't like to use the title "UI/UX designer".
I excel in creating logical and emotionally engaging GUIs, underpinned by strong IA (Information Architecture) and VI (Visual Identity).

I'm based in Wakayama, Japan and work remotely full-time. I've been working remotely since 2016, even before COVID-19, so I'm used to it.

At work, I'm usually the primary designer for projects or organizations that don't have one. My tasks include UI design, user research and modeling, VI/CI design for branding, graphic design for marketing, and providing support for hiring designers - all in one place.

On my days off, I enjoy working on personal projects. Lately, I've been getting into typeface design and I'm currently creating a font for programming.
