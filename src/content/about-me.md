My name is Masaaki Morishita, and I'm passionate about creating cool things with computers. You can call me a designer or an engineer—either title fits.

At my job, I often wear the hat of the go-to designer for projects or places without one. I juggle a lot – from UI design and coding up it, digging into user research and modeling, to crafting VI/CI for branding and whipping up graphics for marketing. Basically, I'm your all-in-one package.

Off the clock, I delve into personal projects like typeface design and font engineering, diving deep into the details. I make everything I create open source, so feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/masaakim) if you're interested.
