I'm Masaaki Morishita, and I've got a passion for creating cool stuff with computers. Feel free to label me as a designer or engineer – either works for me.

At my job, I often wear the hat of the go-to designer for projects or places without one. I juggle a lot – from UI design and coding up it, digging into user research and modeling, to crafting VI/CI for branding and whipping up graphics for marketing. Oh, and I also help out with hiring designers. Basically, I'm your all-in-one package.

When I'm not on the clock, I love diving into personal projects. Recently, I've been exploring the world of typeface design and font engineering – really getting into the nitty-gritty of it. Pretty much everything I create, I make open source. Take a peek at my [GitHub](https://github.com/masaakim) if you're curious.
